Intel's NPU stands for Neural Processing Unit
<!--more-->
#### Key features
It is a type of specialized computer chip designed by Intel to accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads. NPUs are optimized to handle the complex mathematical calculations required for deep learning models, such as neural networks.
Intel's NPU is designed to work alongside the central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide a more efficient and scalable solution for AI and ML applications. The NPU is specifically designed to handle tasks such as:
* Deep learning inference
* Natural language processing
* Computer vision
* Recommendation systems
